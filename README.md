# Laptop Price Prediction Project

This project aims to predict laptop prices based on various features using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project contains information about different laptops including their specifications and prices.

## Libraries Used

- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Essential for numerical computing and handling arrays.
- **Seaborn**: Helps in data visualization, particularly for statistical analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: A versatile plotting library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
- **scikit-learn (sklearn)**: Provides a range of machine learning algorithms and tools for data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation.
  - **train_test_split**: For splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
  - **StandardScaler**: Used for standardization of features.
  - **RandomForestRegressor**: Ensemble learning method for regression tasks.
